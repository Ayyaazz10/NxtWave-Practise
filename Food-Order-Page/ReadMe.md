# Happy Meals

This is a practice project where I built a simple landing page.  
I used **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** to create a background image with a card containing a heading, description, and button.

## What I Learned
- How to set a full-screen background image.
- Creating and styling a card with custom colors.
- Using Google Fonts for better typography.
- Centering content with Bootstrap utilities.
